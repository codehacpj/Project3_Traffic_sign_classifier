\textbf{Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project}

The goals / steps of this project are the following: * Load the data set
(see below for links to the project data set) * Explore, summarize and
visualize the data set * Design, train and test a model architecture *
Use the model to make predictions on new images * Analyze the softmax
probabilities of the new images * Summarize the results with a written
report

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The size of training set is 34799
\item
  The size of the validation set is 4410
\item
  The size of test set is 12630
\item
  The shape of a traffic sign image is (32\emph{32}3)
\item
  The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43
\end{itemize}

Bar charts for the dataset:

Something to be noted, parts of dataset doesn't have equal sizes. It has
to be shuffled before use and even then we could fall into pitfalls.
This non uniformity has to be kept in mind.

Then the image data was normalized inorder to balance the weights space
and to prevent diversing in training process. Examples of normalization:

The model was trained using AdamOptimizer and learning rate of 0.001 to
minimize loss. It runs for 25 epochs with batch size of 64.

My final model results were: * training set accuracy of 0.997 *
validation set accuracy of 0.961 * test set accuracy of 0.947

LeNet-5 was choosen as the base architecture as the original
experimentation was based on the classification of the number images,
this problem has many images with the numbers in them and the overall
problem is almost similar to what LeNet-5 first solved. Last layer was
made to classify 43 different traffic signs instead of regular 10 class
classificaiton of LeNet-5.

For the first iteration, number of epochs=10, batch size = 128 and the
sigma(weight variance) was selected to be 0.1.
\includegraphics{iteration1.PNG}

the validation accuracy went upto 94.5

For the second iteration, number of epochs=20, batch size = 128 and the
sigma(weight variance) was selected to be 0.08.
\includegraphics{iteration2.PNG}

The validation accuracy went upto 95.0

For the second iteration, number of epochs=25, batch size = 64 and the
sigma(weight variance) was selected to be 0.08. In addition to these one
dropout layer was added before last 2 fully connected layer.
\includegraphics{iteration3.PNG}

The validation accuracy went upto 96.1 Dropout layer has played an
important role to help train neural network not relying on certain
subset of neurons by dropping out 50\% neurons randomly while training.
This model has pretty good accuracy and thus this was selected as the
final architecture.

I downloaded test images from German Traffic Sign Recognition dataset on
the web. I used 16 of the random images to test the model. The image in
4th row and 3rd column is difficult to classify. It's classified as
speed limit 80km/h, but it could easily classified as other speed limit.

The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 5 traffic signs, which
gives an accuracy of 100\%. The accuracy is higher than the test set
accuraccy and it might have resulted from the fact that there are very
few test samples that I selected.
